    "selftext": "I wanted to share my experience for those who are considering leverage trading.\n\nI've been in this space for over a decade and early on I learned I should stay away from leverage... or rather I thought I did. For some reason (long story) I decided to go long on bitcoin with leverage. I wanted to be stress-free so I kept a significant balance (5 figures) and used little margin. I entered at around 82k last week and my liquidation was at around 74k, which I thought was very safe. All was good until Sunday. I can't explain the stress I suffered the following days. At some point the price touched 74.4k, very close to liquidation. The whole time I was literally [this guy](https://www.memeatlas.com/images/wojaks/wojak-stage-6-doomer.png) looking at the chart deciding whether to exit and lose 60/70/80% or wait. I couldn't work, eat, spend time with family or friends, or do anything other than think about why I did this stupid trade. It was money that I could afford to lose, but the psychological damage of losing it would have been hard. In any case I decided to wait. Fortunately yesterday I was able to exit safely with minimal loss (I could have waited more and exit with gains but I wanted to be out ASAP).\n\nI think my life expectancy just dropped a little after all this, but hopefully this time I learned the lesson. No more leverage trading for me. I truly can't believe people do this on a daily basis!",

However, my main concern is managing the repayment process.\n\nFor example, if I pledge *x* BTC as collateral for a loan of *x* dollars, the arrangement would require monthly repayments (interest, and possibly part of the principal). So, my question is: How do you fund these repayments without ever having to sell your BTC? Do you rely on other income sources entirely, or are there creative strategies that have worked for you?\n\nI'm curious about your experiences, insights, and any pitfalls you've encountered with this strategy. Looking forward to your advice!\n\nThanks in advance.",

Over the following months turned into years and I pretty much forgot all about it until I started seeing that it was making waves again at the end of last year. I checked and to my surprise my money invested had more than doubled! Excited as I was, I still did not sell any. In fact, I finally started dca'ing again. Imagine if I had just stuck to my plan way back in '17 I'd have a pretty hefty chunk by now. Should, coulda, woulda... point is the best time to invest is yesterday, the next best time to invest is today. Even though as of today I'm only up 13% overall, at least something happened that got me back in. It's fun watching my Sats grow every week.

You're dumb like 99% of people (me included).\n\nIt's not that difficult:\n\n1. Pay all your monthly bills.\n\n2. See how much money you have left (if you have zero... Well... I will pray for you).\n\n3. Decide how much of that money will be used to buy Bitcoin. I will not say the annoying cliche \"OnLy iNveSt WhaT yOu cAn afFord tO lOsE\", because let's be honest..\nmost people can't afford to lose a single thing, they're desperate for a solution.\n\nSo the best advice I could give you is: Because of the halving cycle which happens every 4 years or so, Bitcoin tends to be higher than it was before after 4 years, but between the time you buy and that 4 year time frame, a bear market can occur. So make sure to just buy Bitcoin not with \"what you can't afford to lose\", but with an amount of money you can afford to leave untouched for AT LEAST 4 YEARS. That way if a bear market starts you can wait for a better opportunity to leave without selling at a loss.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n4. Besides the previously advice, the ideal scenario is: NEVER SELL YOUR BITCOIN. HODL FOREVER.\nThat's not some meme advice, there's a reason why people tell everyone that.\nIf you sell your Bitcoin you're exchanging a valuable asset that increases its value over time, for an asset (USD, EUR, etc) that is based on being infinitely printed, decreasing its value over time. Why the hell would you do that?\n\nIf you keep your money in Bitcoin, 4 years from now you will need less Bitcoin to buy the same stuff today. On the other hand if you keep your money in Fiat, you will need more Fiat to buy the same stuff today.\n\nThe only situation you should sell your Bitcoin for Fiat is if you need to use fiat to pay for something that will save your life or the life of someone you love. Because at the end of the day that's more important than money.\n\nBut if you have another choice, always chose not to sell your Bitcoin. You have no reason to sell your Bitcoin. You can spend your Bitcoin if you want and replace it later, that's what Bitcoin was created for. But don't exchange your valuable Sats for trash Fiat without a really good reason. I can guarantee that you will regret it in the next 4 years.",

    "selftext": "I see a lot of people not understanding why Saylor says that Bitcoin is not competing with the dollar. I'll explain it by using my freezer analogy.\n\nBitcoin is like a freezer and the dollar is like a refrigerator. Freezers do not compete with refrigerators. When you go shopping for a new refrigerator you are not comparing it to your deep freezer you have at home. Why? Because they both do different things and both solve different problems we have with food.\n\nIf you want to make eggs and have those for breakfast *tomorrow* or in the next *week* you keep them chilled but not frozen. If you want to drink milk or use some cheese you are going to keep them in a ready state. Are they slowly going bad? Yes. But you are willing to accept that for the ability to consume them anytime you want in the short-term without having to wait or have a weird taste.\n\nIf you want to preserve steak for 6+ months because you know you'll use it, just not sure when, you deep freeze it. If you want to keep food with certain properties because they are better that way (such as ice cream) you deep freeze it. Sure, you could always take the steak out and eat it, but it's going to hurt, a lot.\n\nIf you take Bitcoin and spend it, it's going to hurt, a lot. It's highest and best use case is not as a currency. It *can* be used as a currency just like the frozen steak *can* be eaten, however that's not ideal. It's highest and best use case is as a store of value against all other forms of spoilage and decay.\n\nLast thought and I'll leave you with this....... Imagine you go over to your family's house and every time you're there they complain about food going bad and how they cannot store lots of meat and other things like ice cream. They don't understand how other people are doing it. And when you ask them to show you, you notice they only have a refrigerator in their kitchen! Well, your solution for them wouldn't be to tell them to get rid of the refrigerator because that's the thing causing them to not store food long term. You would tell them that they need to go buy a freezer and that will allow them to not only store food for longer but more of it! They can keep the refrigerator, it has it's place in the kitchen, but they need to understand it's purpose and that they're not supposed to use it to store ice cream.\n\nThis is what Michael Saylor means when he says that Bitcoin doesn't compete with the dollar.",

I do acknowledge that.\n\nThe most important question is, is escaping the Matrix and the 9-5 still possible or not?\n\nBTC is the highest return investment currently in existence, but if the market cap doesn't reach 15-20T, I don't see how BTC can help me escape.\n\nSince BTC is the highest return asset on Earth, if it can't help, then nothing can.\n\nShould I just give up or keep living in artificial scarcity made by me so I can have more money to invest in Bitcoin?\n\nPsychologically, I may be able to withstand to 2040, but continuing after that won't be possible. In other words, Bitcoin will either succeed long-term or I will press my turn off button (you know what I mean \ud83d\ude22 )\n\nGive me only serious answers.\n\nThanks.",

    "title": "The Future of the United States\u2019 Economy \u2014 is There One?",
    "selftext": "*From my substack.*  \n  \n*Update: Today, Chinese tariffs have increased from the previously calculated 54%, to 105%. This has taken the estimated 5% increase in inflation from tariffs alone, to 7.1%,* ***bringing the total inflation estimates within a year from now to around 10%*** *\u2014 and this is without an increase in the money supply, just from rising prices.* *Depending on the response in interest rates from the Federal Reserve, this could rise.*\n\n*The used estimates are not meant to be perfectly accurate, but rather a numerical representation of principles at play. A friend pointed out the important factor that many of the goods imported from countries under high tariffs, like China, will be replaced with countries that have lower tariffs, which is not taken account in the following math. Due to the difficulty in such estimates, it will be purposefully left out, but I would keep it in mind.*\n\n*This is financial information, not advice.*\n\n*--*\n\nI wrote an article attaching theoretical increased inflation numbers that could occur due to recently announced vehicle tariffs by the United States. This resulted in an estimated **1.6%** CPI increase. Add that to the last reported inflation rate of 3.14%, resulting in a significant **4.74% inflation rate with auto tariffs alone.**\n\nAt the time, the automobile tariffs were considered the biggest factor in terms of anticipated economic impact \u2014 but now pale in comparison to the recent announcement, which apply to all goods including The United States\u2019 major trading partners.\n\nPutting the economic impact of new tariffs into perspective, about 10 to 17% of items purchased in the CPI basket are imported goods. Due to production processes including imported goods but assembled in the US and other factors, I\u2019d venture to say the 17% number is closer to accurate.\n\nWe\u2019ll do some very quick on a napkin on the back of a hand math:\n\nOf that 17% of the CPI basket, here are it\u2019s compositional estimates, and associated price increases with the new tariffs:  \n29% comes from China, 4.93% of the total basket, with 72.27% increase in item cost.  \n26% from Mexico, 4.42% of the total basket, with 25% increase in item cost.  \n15% from EU, 2.55% of the total basket, with 16.5% increase in item cost.  \n10% from Vietnam, 1.7% of the total basket, with 36.25% increase in item cost.  \n9% from Canada, 1.53% of the total basket, with 25% increase in item cost.  \n11% from elsewhere, 1.87% of the total basket, with 9.52% increase in item cost.\n\nIf you calculate a $100 basket of CPI goods with old tariffs, it would cost $106.27 with the new tariffs. **An inflation increase of 6.27%**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cgz1n5zngute1.png?width=1882&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc503260d5642c7383f99b17534fc09365502206\n\n*Note: This is a general estimate assuming that imported goods are evenly weighted across the CPI basket. One could get a more accurate estimate by narrowing down what percentage of each weighted category is made by which country, but such specificity on what is already a guesstimate is unnecessary. The \u2018other\u2019 imported category is an assumed 9.52% increase, but with the new tariffs, it\u2019s likely more significant.*\n\nLet\u2019s take that 6.27% and add in some other factors.\n\nThese calculations have included the auto tariff previously calculated, but not insurance, which was a .25% increase, bringing our total increase to 6.52%\n\nDomestic production is also influenced by tariffs. We will add a conservative .33% increase in cost of CPI goods by domestic sources giving us **an estimated total 6.85% inflationary increase.**\n\nAdd that onto the current inflation rate of 3.14% and **we could see 10% inflation numbers within a year**. I believe this to be conservative.\n\nAverage US citizens are already struggling to live day to day, and these tariffs are a strong squeeze on an already stressed economy with little wiggle room. Any more pressure could cause economic flatline, and a significant step towards broader debt default. The Federal Reserve will have to lower rates at some point, the question is just how much blood will be in the street before they do \u2014 and if past sentiment prevails, I\u2019m willing to guess quite a bit.\n\nLet\u2019s observe some potential universes resulting from this situation.\n\n**Universe 1: Interest rates** ***are*** **lowered significantly and/or quickly enough to prevent significant economic damage. United States\u2019 domestic production** ***also*** **increases in time.**  \nThis is best case scenario. Yes, inflation significantly increases, but so do domestic jobs. Your eggs now cost $6/dozen, but you and your friends are employed, and ideally $20k more a year than pre-tariff.\n\nYou can think of this equivalent to the United States creating significantly more USD, but most of it going to US citizens rather than foreign entities. I\u2019m in assumption that this is the actual end goal of the current administration.\n\n**Universe 2: Interest rates** ***are not*** **lowered significantly and/or quickly enough to prevent significant economic damage. United States\u2019 domestic production** ***does not*** **increase in time**.  \nA lack of cooperation between the US Federal Reserve and The White House would result in these tariffs wrecking the US Economy. Significant job loss and rising cost of living would create broad loan defaults, including the US government, leading to potential bank runs, etc. However, I don\u2019t think a point of no return is truly the case, and can probably be remedied at some point through evasive action.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen or read Ray Dalio\u2019s The Changing World Order, he mentions that nations would rather inflate their currency than default on loans and I agree. So it\u2019s not a matter of *if* The Fed increases rates, but rather *when* they do, and if they do so adequately. The variable is how many people and businesses economically or spiritually die before then.\n\nNo matter the universe we enter, it will contain inflation, and economic instability. Those are the two economic conditions you can count on.\n\nHow to prepare for such environments? Seek antifragile philosophy, live off of less, contribute what you can, and the universe will give back.",

There will be no longer the money from the export of dollars that the trade surpluses generated in favor of the Asian tigers. There will be no longer this money to buy treasuries, bonds and government securities issued by the US Treasury Department. There will be no longer this money, what will replace the Asian tigers will be the M2. I would not doubt that BTC in the next few days could eventually explode to 85,000 or 87,000. It is not a question of catching the falling knife, as some say, it is a question of mathematics. If the Fed does not turn on the money printer immediately, the world as we know it will simply disappear.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts about how this could benefit Bitcoin in the mid to long term.",

A situation where a CBDC \"new dollar\" or euro is pegged to bitcoin or gold for example. \n\nEventually, they would de-peg it to print more since they would have the ability to do so.\n\nSo my question is, how is bitcoin any different than gold in this regard? Gold did not solve the problem of central banks ability to print and debase currency, how would something pegged to bitcoin differ in any way? People could still transact in gold always, but obviously, due to portability and verifiability issues, it did not make it very convenient to do so. \n\nIs this where bitcoin differs? People would be able to transact without the hurdles of gold, and in theory would actually PREFER to transact in bitcoin rather than a CBDC? \n\nI think we are witnessing a global order restructuring in real time and all roads lead to bitcoin, but just curious on how that could look like? How would it be different than any other time where a new currency is created, and to give it confidence, it is pegged to a hard asset like gold. How would pegging it to bitcoin be any different? \n\nIs the general belief that no other currency will exist because they would not be able to compete with the immutability and \"hardness\" of bitcoin?\n\nAny insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance",
